It looks like your working directory is clean with no changes to commit, but you have an untracked file, ../.gitignore, that exists outside of your tests directory. 

Steps to Manage the .gitignore File
Review the .gitignore File:

If this .gitignore file is intended for your project, you should add it to your Git repository so that Git can begin to ignore the specified files listed in it.
Add the .gitignore File:
Navigate to the parent directory or directly specify the path to your .gitignore file to add it to the repository:

bash
Copy
git add ../.gitignore
Commit the Changes:
After adding the .gitignore, commit the change:

bash
Copy
git commit -m "Add .gitignore to ignore unnecessary files"
Verify the Status Again:
Run git status to confirm that all is in order:

bash
Copy
git status
Example of What to Include in .gitignore
